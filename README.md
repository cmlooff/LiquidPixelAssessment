# LiquidPixelAssessment

### Instructions:
1. Clone repo to local repo
2. npm install
3. npm start
4. Click the buttons to change state!

### Approach:
1. Looking at the problem statement I found that the challenge was to show state change as instant visual information for the customer.
2. Seeking to create an MVP product under a two hour sprint:
    * I chose React because I was comfortable with creating a stateful product under the sprint requisite.
    * React allows for component-based reprocessing via the virtual DOM.
    * I chose to pick two attributes - color and size.
    * Using these two attributes I created three buttons for each that changes the state of a simple div container that represents a circle. 

### Talking Points:
1. Going from the problem statement I created an MVP that I thought was suitable for the under two hour sprint.
2. Going forward:
    * I could've added additional features like an active state for the buttons.
    * I could've cropped the LiquidPixel demo photos and changed out the photos depending on the color selected.
        * This would've been handled by className logic
3. I kept things as simple as possible to show case the logic rather than adding components that might've deviated from the MVP.
4. Feel free to reach out and I could add additional features to the MVP to showcase anything else you might want to see.
